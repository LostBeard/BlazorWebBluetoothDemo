## Introduction

The **Blazor Web Bluetooth Demo** demonstrates communication between a Blazor WASM web application and an ESP32-S3 using Bluetooth Low Enery communication via the Web Bluetooth API. 
Uses [SpawnDev.BlazorJS](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS) to access the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API).
The `ESP32BLEApp` is a [VSCode with PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) project that runs on the ESP32-S3-WROOM board and runs a GATT service that provides access to data and control over GPIO pins. 
The `BlazorWebBluetoothDemo` is a Blazor WebAssembly project uses the Web Bluetooth API to communicate with the GATT service running on the ESP32 wirelessly.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo.
- Upload the `ESP32BLEApp` project to your ESP32-S3-WROOM board using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).
- Open the `BlazorWebBluetoothDemo` project in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the Blazor WebAssembly project to start the demo in a new browser window.
- Click `Connect to BLE Device` to see a list of available Bluetooth devices. 
- Select `ESP32` to `Pair` your ESP32-S3-WROOM board to the Blazor web app.
- The Blazor app will:
  - Request a specific GATT service running on the ESP32.
  - Get a specific Characteristic from that GATT service.
  - Read the Characteristic's current value.
  - Subscribe to value change events for that Characteristic and update the value shown.
- Click the `ON` and `OFF` buttons to control the ESP32's onboard LED accessed via another Charateristic.

## Features

- **Web Bluetooth API Integration**: Directly connect and communicate with BLE devices.
- **ESP32-S3-WROOM Support**: Utilize the powerful features of the ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Build interactive web applications using C# and .NET.
- **Real-time Data Exchange**: Send and receive data between the web app and Bluetooth devices.

## ESP32-S3-WROOM
This project uses the ESP32-S3-WROOM microcontroller board, which is a powerful and versatile platform for building IoT applications. The ESP32-S3 features built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities, making it an ideal choice for this demo.
