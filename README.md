## Introduction

The **Blazor Web Bluetooth Demo** demonstrates communication between a Blazor WASM web application and an ESP32-S3 using Bluetooth Low Enery commincation via the Web Bluetooth API. With [SpawnDev.BlazorJS](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS), you can create Blazor WASM web pages that interact with various Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Bluetooth technology into web applications, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.

## Features

- **Web Bluetooth API Integration**: Directly connect and communicate with BLE devices.
- **ESP32-S3-WROOM Support**: Utilize the powerful features of the ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Build interactive web applications using C# and .NET.
- **Real-time Data Exchange**: Send and receive data between the web app and Bluetooth devices.

## ESP32-S3-WROOM
This project uses the ESP32-S3-WROOM microcontroller board, which is a powerful and versatile platform for building IoT applications. The ESP32-S3 features built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities, making it an ideal choice for this demo.
