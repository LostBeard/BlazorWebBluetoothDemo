# Blazor Web Bluetooth Demo ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Blazor Web Bluetooth Demo**! This project showcases how to use the Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) framework with the Web Bluetooth API to communicate with an ESP32-S3-WROOM microcontroller board. Whether you're a developer looking to explore Bluetooth technology or a hobbyist interested in microcontrollers, this demo provides a solid foundation for your projects.

## Introduction

- The **Blazor Web Bluetooth Demo** demonstrates communication between a Blazor WASM web application and an ESP32-S3 using Bluetooth Low Energy communication via the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API). 
- The `ESP32BLEApp` folder contains a [VSCode with PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) project that runs on the ESP32-S3-WROOM board and hosts a BLE GATT Service that provides access to data and control over GPIO pins. 
- The `BlazorWebBluetoothDemo` folder contains a Blazor WebAssembly project that uses the Web Bluetooth API to communicate with the GATT Service running on the ESP32 wirelessly.
- [SpawnDev.BlazorJS](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS) is used to access the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API).

## Live Demo 

- Run the `ESP32BLEApp` app on your ESP32-S3-WROOM board
- Run the [Live Demo](https://lostbeard.github.io/BlazorWebBluetoothDemo/)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo.
- Upload and run the `ESP32BLEApp` project on your ESP32-S3-WROOM board using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).
- The ESP32 app will run a BLE GATT Service with two [Characteristics](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt#characteristics-640991):
  - `LED` - used to control the onboard LED.
  - `Sensor` - used to read the current value of a fake sensor.
- Open the `BlazorWebBluetoothDemo` project in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the Blazor WebAssembly project to start the demo in a new browser window.
- Click `Connect to BLE Device` to see a list of available Bluetooth devices. 
- Select `ESP32` to `Pair` your ESP32-S3-WROOM board to the Blazor web app.
- The Blazor app will:
  - Request a specific GATT Service running on the ESP32.
  - Get a specific GATT Service Characteristic from that GATT Service.
  - Read the GATT Service Characteristic's current value.
  - Subscribe to value change events for that GATT Service Characteristic and update the value shown.
- Click the `ON` and `OFF` buttons to control the ESP32's onboard LED accessed via another GATT Service Characteristic.

## Features

- **Web Bluetooth API Integration**: Directly connect and communicate with BLE devices.
- **ESP32-S3-WROOM Support**: Utilize the powerful features of the ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Build interactive web applications using C# and .NET.
- **Real-time Data Exchange**: Send and receive data between the web app and Bluetooth devices.

## ESP32-S3-WROOM
This project uses the ESP32-S3-WROOM microcontroller board, which is a powerful and versatile platform for building IoT applications. The ESP32-S3 features built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities, making it an ideal choice for this demo.
